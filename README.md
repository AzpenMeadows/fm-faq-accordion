## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to make accordian tabs close when another one is opened, but for now I think my time would be bette served learning more about Javascript in general rather than going down a rabit hole of uing methods I do not yet understand
